My website

Javascript involves moving the state away from the server and into the client (i.e. the browser).

Client Side backbone.js application - routers for handling page transitions. - views for rendering models. - models for representing data in the app. - collections - for managing many models.

Servers-  serve initial application and provide RESTful client-side services for the client model.

Server and Client exchange JSON node data over http protocol. 

Pros- fast, highly interactive, scalable

Cons- cannot be indexed by searched engines, client-side applications are hard to test, security issues
