#Best Practices for Designing an Interface

**keep the interface simple**

**create consistency and user common UI elements**

**be purposeful in page layout**

**strategically use color and texture**

**use typography to create hierarchy and clarity**

**make sure that the system communicates what's happening**

**think about the defaults**


Light - create depth using light and shadow

Color - use heat to manage focus. 
  - Cold colors - blue and green shades.
  - Warm colors - red and yellow
  Warmer colors expand when placed next to colder colors, they literally spill out and take dominance. 

Contrast - attract attention with higher contrast
  Higher contrast items stand out - they catch your eye.
