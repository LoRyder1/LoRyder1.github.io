# Sprockets

**Why does Sprockets need saving?**

Sprockets is the Asset Pipeline. "A maintainer does not owe you anthing". Not even an explanation. You owe a maintainer respect. Words without actions are empty. 

**Intro**

Sprockets is a Ruby library for compiling and serving web assets. It features declarative dependency management for JavaScript and CSS assets, as well as a powerful preprocessor pipeline that allows you to write assets in languages like CoffeeScript, Sass and SCSS.
