<em>Week #7: </em>

<h3>Exploring your values: 
</h3>
<p>What are the values that come to mind when I've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied?
</p>
<p>Courage, Freedom, Growth, Meaning, Vibrancy, and Serenity
</p>
<p> I think Courage is the value that means the most to me. Maya Angelou said that "Courage is the most important of virtues, because without courage you can't practice any other virtue consistenty. You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothin consistently without courage." Also Ernest Hemingway defined courage as : "grace under pressure". Courage to me is very hard sometimes and to be brave under the most extenuating circumstances is difficult. But it the most difficult and hard things that bring the most reward. The reward I speek of is not worldly things but something more. Having martial courage despite the difficulties is an end in itself. 
</p>
<p>Values in my Life ( I try to live up to these values): Courage: 4, Freedom: 3, Growth: 4, Meaning: 4, Vibrancy: 3, Serenity: 3.

<h3>How do I feel when I think about your values?
</h3>
<p>I think when it comes to values and realizes vulnerabilities its important to recognize that your not alone. A when your in those weak moments its important to reach out and communicate and be with friends and family. I guess I could try the "ignorance is bliss" but that not how I can live, I need to know my vulnerabilities and weaknesses no matter how low it brings me or the amount of discomfort of suffereing. "We must be greater than our suffering".
