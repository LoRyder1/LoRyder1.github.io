**React** is an open-source JavaScript library providing a view for data rendered as HTML. React views are typically rendered using components that contain additional components specified as custom HTML tags. React promises programmers a model in which subcompents cannot directly affect enclosing components ("data flows down"); efficient updating of the HTML document when data changes; and a clean separation between components on a modern single-page application. 

#One-way Data flow

Properties, a set of immutable values, are passed to a component's renderer as properties in its HTML tag. 

# Virtual DOM

Another notable feature is the use of a virtual DOM. React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browswer's displayed DOM efficiently. 

#JSX

React components are typically written in JSX, a JavaScript extension syntax allowing easy quoting of HTML and using HTML tag syntax to render subcomponents. 

# Architecture Beyond HTML

The basic architecture of React applies beyond rendering HTML in the browswer.
