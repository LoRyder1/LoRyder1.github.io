#One-way Data flow

Properties, a set of immutable values, are passed to a component's renderer as properties in its HTML tag. 

# Virtual DOM

Another notable feature is the use of a virtual DOM. React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browswer's displayed DOM efficiently. 

#JSX

React components are typically written in JSX, a JavaScript extension syntax allowing easy quoting of HTML and using HTML tag syntax to render subcomponents.
