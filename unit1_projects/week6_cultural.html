<h3>Stereotype Threat - Claude M. Steele
</h3>
<p> There is underperformance of groups when they are stereotyped. Diversity problem- one thing to integrate numerically, another where everyone feels they can flourish. Social Identity - our sense of who we are. If you have to deal with things because of your identity then it affects your sense of identity- Identity contigencies. It becomes who you are, it structures the way you think. Identity is very situational. 
</p>
<p>"People often see themselves in term of whichever one of their allegiances (identities) is under attack..." - Amin Maalouf
</p>
<p> Being in a situation where the stereotype can be applied to you = stereotype threat. Frustration is the ingredient that makes the stereotype active in performance. Caring makes you the most vulnerable to the identity contigencies. Very little subjective sense of the threat: everyone will deny it. Underperforming because your trying too hard - it makes you the most vulnerable. 
</p>
<p> Bad news: Identity is intrinsic to most diverse settings, the default state of affairs unless something is done to reduce it. 
</p>

<h3> How to mitigate the Stereotype Threat
</h3>
<p> Identity Security - give a sense of belonging, and reasurance. Strategies for Identity safety: leadership, critical mass, resist permanent tracking, deracializing perception of setting, self-affirmation, belongingness interventions, challenge and support, relationships, wise teaching. 
</p>
<p>The old axiom that "ignorance is bliss" hold true with stereotypes - the more you believe in them, the more they may be true for you. Stereotypes box us into unconscious expectations for ourselves (and often, others too).
