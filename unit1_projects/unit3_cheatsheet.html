<em>Unit 3 Cheatsheet: </em>

<h3>Using an Object in Javascript
</h3>
<p>Charge c1;
c1 = new Charge (.51, .63, 21.3) ; 
double v = c1.potentialAt(x, y) ;
</p>
<p>Charge is the new variable and c1 is the object name.    (c1 = ) is where you are invoking a constructor to create a new objet. c1 being the object name and .potential invoking an instance method that operates on the object's value. 
</p>
<p>Creating an object. Instance variables
public class Charge
{
private final double rx, ry; 
}
instance variable declarations
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<h3>Constructors
</h3>
<p>public Charg (double x0, double y0, double q0)
rx = x0;
ry =y0;
q= q0;
</p>
<p>public is access modifier, Charge is the constructor name (same as the class name) next is the argument variables.rx , ry and q are the instance variables 
</p>
<p>
</p>

<h3>Java Basic Syntax
</h3>
<p>A Java program can be defined as a collections of objets that communicate via invoking each other's methods. 
</p>
<p>Object - Objects have states and behaviors. Ex: A dog has states- color, name, breed as well as behaviors - wagging, braking, eating. An object is an instance of a class
</p>
<p>Class - a class can be defined as a template/blue print that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support
</p>
<p>Methods - A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods, It is in methods where the logics are wrtten, data is manipulated adn the actions are executed. 
</p>
<p>Instance variables - Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables
</p>

<h3> Basic Syntax
</h3>
<p>Case sensitivity, class names - first letter should be in Upper Case, all method names should start with a lower case letter each inner word should be upper case
</p>
<p>Program name should exactly match the class name
</p>
<p>
</p>
