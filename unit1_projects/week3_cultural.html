<em>Week #3: </em>

<h3>Research your thinking style and consider how you can use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC to help you learn




</h3>
<p> My thinking styles are Concrete Sequential and Abstract Sequential. My score was tied on those two thinking styles. I don't know if that means I am well rounded or just lean towards those thinking styles over the other ones. 
</p>
<p> According to my thinking style I tend to base myself on reality and process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way. Also I love the world of theory and abstract theory. These two thinking styles seem to be contradictory but they aren't. 
</p> 
<p> Some more detail on my thinking style: I am persistent and product oriented, a "by the numbers" person. Practical and detail oriented, the list-makers of the world. THat seems like a boring characterization of a person. Also I am idea oriented, very analytical, and verbal, as well as easily bored. 

</p>
<p> Now that I know what kind of thinking style I may be, the way I can use that to my advantage in DBC is first of all have a set schedule. Being ordered and following a schedule is good for me. It keeps me grounded and focused on the things that I need to do. I think changing my environment so that its more practical, quiet and stable, mentally stimulating and non-authoritative. I think those last two points and pretty important for me. I think I do tend to get bored and like to move on; I also like to be in a non-authoritative environment. I just hate doing things when I'm told to do them. I will specifically not do them when they are asked of me sometimes. I think it requires a certain level of humility to do them anyway. I just feel like it diminishes my intiative and me when I don't do things of my own volition. I want to do things only because I want to do them not because others ask or want me to do them. There is some arrogance there. 
</p>

<h3>Consider your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.

</h3>
<p>My experience in Phase 0 to this point has been a little tumultuous. I think the biggest struggle has been getting the work done on time the way that I want to get it done. I feel like I am half-assing some parts of the challenges and am not giving my best effort. I have more to give because it totally feels like I can and could do better. I think some of the blame can be on my thinking style. I need to just have a set schedule on accomplishing all the challenges and work on time and then go back and make it better and then better. Action plan: wake up earlier and just do it.

<h3>Now, consider the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset. Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively
</h3>
<p> I like the mindset on how our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. This is of course of the growth mindset. Part of my mindset is that I don't like changes very much. I feel at home doing the same routine and do things the way I always do them. I am really slow on absorbing change and so am a little inflexible. I also don't really like to organize information by reflection. Being in people oriented environments I think bog me down because a lot of times they are unstructured and just randomness without any actual work getting done. I think this is my pride at work. I feel like the only way I can contribute is when I have mastered a subject. I also don't like to experiment. Experimenting to me is just trying new things without knowing if they work or not. Not knowing = a waste of time. 
</p>
<p>In order to grow and become more well rounded I need to learn to be more open to communication. By communication I mean with others as well as with myself. I think it is important to self reflect and organize info, it makes one more coherent in life and in decisions. I also could try to be more of a people centric kind of person. I think that would be hard since its one of my weaknesses - i'm more of an introvert. Experimenting is another thinking style that I need to work on. Without experimenting I don't know what's out there. It all comes down to being adaptable, flexible, receptive, and more open to the world around you. Being more well rounded would help me become more "hardcore"!
