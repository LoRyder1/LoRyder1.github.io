How did you feel when you read your feedback?
Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?
How was it to write feedback?
What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?
Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?

<h3>Pairing
</h3>
<p>Pairing with others is a different experience. I think it is pretty important to be able to communicate with others. It's important to develop your abilities on recognizing problems together, diving work, communicating issues so you understand the problem and so does your pair. We tend to think computer programming is just a lonesome job, but it can and should be a social job in order to get things done. There are a lot of benefits to pair programming. Programming has come to be about ideas and the cross fertilization of ideas and that usually happens with social interactions. Social programming also makes coding more fun. There is this extra element added when your doing work in a social setting with help or using teamwork. There is more feeling and emotion when doing pair programming. It makes both programmers better even the better experience one. Everyone looks through the world or coding in a different way. The light that goes through our understanding is refracted just a little bit differently by each individual. The most difficult part of pairing is being knowledgeable at the same level as the other programmer. There exist some anxiety of not knowing your stuff when pairing. The other individual might be a lot more prepared and able to accomplish a lot more.

<h3>Feedback
</h3>
<p>I like reading my feedback. I think we are sometimes overly sensitive or can I say touchy when it comes to criticisms. Criticisms are important to read and listen to. Sometimes we take them personally and think we can not change and that is the way we are and so destined be that way forever. We hate criticism of ourselves when look at it as something we can not change. The thing is we can change a lot of things regarding ourselves. The way we take criticisms can be for the better: we need to have the growth mindset. I think the feedback I received sure was helpful in helping me be better. The next time I pair I am going to be more relaxed and not be in such a hurry all the time. It is important to take your time when getting things done. Also being more prepared and not shy about asking questions is really good to do. Writing feedback for other people was great. Sometimes I felt like I was nitpicking things that weren't too bad but would probably off balance people. Off balancing people can sometimes be a good thing because it makes people work at being better and not just think they are perfect. Everyone could be better no matter where you are on the coding ladder. I think the most difficult part about writing feedback was writing negative things; but that just means its really important. I think the key is to be really honest. Overall the Socrates feedback is generally a good thing and helps us improve our learning. It is hard to self-assess yourself but again it is critical to look at yourself through other peoples' eyes. To be completely objective when critqueing yourself is next to impossible.
