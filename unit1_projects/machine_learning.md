#Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. 

Machine learning is closely related to and often overlaps with computational statistics; a discipline which also focuses in prediction making through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is often conflated with data mining, where the latter sub-field focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning. 

Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction. These analytical models allow analysts to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results and uncover hidden insights through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data.
