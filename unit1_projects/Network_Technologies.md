#Firewall(computing)

A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted secure internal network and another outside network, such as the internet, that is assumed not to be secure or trusted. Firewalls are often categorized as either **network firewalls** or **host-based firewalls**. Network firewalls are a software appliance running on general purpose hardware or hardware-based firewall computer applications that filter traffic between two or more networks. Host-based firewalls provide a layer of software on one host that controls network traffic in and out of that single machine. Firewall appliances may also offer other functionality to the internal network they protect such as a acting as a DHCP or VPN server for that network. 

#Content filtering (information filtering)

On the internet, content filtering (also known as information filtering) is the use of a program to screen and exclude from access or availability Web pages or e-mail that is deemed objecitonable. Content filtering is used by corporations as part of Internet firewall computers and also by home computer owners, especially by parents to screen  the content their children have access to from a computer. 

Content filtering usually works by specifying character strings that, if matched, indicate undesirable content that is to be screened out. Content is typically screened out. Content is typically screened for pornographic content and sometimes also for violence or hate-oriented content. Critics of content filtering programs point out that it is not difficult to unintentionally exclude desirable content. 

Content filtering and the products that offer this service can be divided into Web filtering, the screending of Web sites or pages, and e-mail filtering, the screening of e-mail for span or other objectionable content.
