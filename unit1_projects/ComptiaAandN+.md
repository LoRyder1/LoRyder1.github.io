#Comptia A+ and N+ 


#DNS - domain name system
Resolving a domain name - domain name to an IP address. Makes it easier for humans to use domain name instead of IP address. Abstracts the web server from the domain name. If you want to update your web server just change the dns records of domain name and point from old ip address to new ip address. 

#Topology - layout how a network communicates with different devices
Star Topology, Bus Topology - no terminators = signal reflection, Ring Topology - easy to trouble shoot, Mesh Topology - handles failure very well, - high redundancy, Hybrid Topology - star ring network and star bus network, Point to Point Topology, Client Server Topology, Point to Multipoint Topology, Peer to Peer Topology

#Firewall - 
Access Control List, Host Based Firewall - software based firewall. Network based Firewall - protects an entire network. Stateful vs Stateless Firewall - Stateful - monitors all connections and data streams that are passing through, keeps a record, dynamic. Stateless - uses an ACL to allow or deny traffic, only looks in header, and does not keep record. 

#Content Filtering - 
looks at content not the source, commonly used to filter email. 

#Signature identification 
used to detect viruses that have a well known behavior pattern.   

#HUb - not intelligent 
Connects network with ethernet cables

#Switch - intelligent
Data directed only to intended port, learns physical addresses and stores them in a table. Reduce an unnecessary traffic. 
Multilayer Switch - Layers 2 and 3 similar to a router in layer 3. Content Switch - can operate at layers 4 through 7 of the OSI model. Can perform load balancing and advanced filtering - very expensive. 

#Spanning Tree protocol
Network with multiple switches - allows for fault tolerance and prevents unnecessary traffic loops in the network. Allows switches to talk to each other to find if loops are happening in the network. 

#Bridges 
Used to divide a network into separate collision domains. Reduces unnecessary traffic based on their MAC address. Filters by MAC address

#Router
Routes data packets based on their IP address. Router is the gateway for its own network. 

#Gateway
Device that joins two networks together. Does not change the data, only changes the format

#CSU/DSU - channel service Unit/ Data service unit
Converts Data from a LAN to a WAN.
