<h3>What is the difference between padding, border and margin?
</h3>
<p>Padding is essentially the space between the content and the border. It makes the content look better and makes it easier on the eyes. Padding generally goes all around the contents. 
</p>
<p>Margin is the space outside the border. THe space is usually pretty large as the content is better read on a pc when it is smaller. On a mobile device with limited screen real estate the elmination of the border can be necessary. 
</p>
<p>Margins and padding are after all very similar in some ways: white space around an image or object. 

</p>
<p>Inside margins of an element are borders. Borders are the "edge" between padding and margin. Every border has three possible characteristics: width, style, colour. Default border width is medium: 2px.
