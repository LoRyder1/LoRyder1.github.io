#7 Reasons to Develop Using Meteor

Meteor is to Node.js as Rails is to Ruby. A few years ago, Rails was the hot new thing on the web, sprinkling some useful 'magic' through the development process to make programming on the web more approachable and pleasant. 

# Appications are real-time by default

most companies are moving toward real-time web. It's inevitable that, sooner than you probably expect, users will expect web applications to work near-instantaneously. I'm sure users already wince whenever a separate page load is required for simple tasks like changing settings and logging out. 

# You can develop with just one language

It is frustrating to use a variety of hats/languages. You have to think about front-end, back-end, and the database. Meteor allows you to just focus on JavaScript. 
Another benefit to writing an entire application with one language. One line of code can run on both the client and the server and do different things in either environment. 

# You can save a lot of time with smart packages

You have the ability to run commands in a terminal, and Meteor adds one of its built-in 'smart packages' to the project. This particular package creates an accounts system that expects an email (or username) and password. Smart packages are not just for accounts though. There's a range of them already available, with more presumably on the way, and they all allow you to do something cool. 

# The community is extremely supportive

Nothing attracts me more to a new framework or technology than an active and vibrant community. Meteor community is already one of its greatest assets. THere's a ton of helpful resources that have spawned from people's love the framework

# It's optimized for developer happiness

Every framework markets itself as a better and more enjoyable way to work. Meteor's attention to detail in holding true to its promise of optimizing for developer happiness
  -  built-in LiveReload feature so you won't have to manually refresh your browser
  - the freedom to structure your projects however you want. There are standards you can follow but no strict rules or conventions
  - The sheer modularity of Meteor that allows you to mix-and-match different components in case one part of Meteor isn't to your liking. 

So While Meteor has its fair shar of 'magic' and conventions to make your life easier, you can still make choices based on your personal preferences. It's the best of both worlds.
