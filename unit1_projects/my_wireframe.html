<strong>Lov's wireframe plan</strong>
</h1>

<p>
	My plan is outlined in this picture</p>


	<div id="wireframe">
				<a href="http://LoRyder1.github.io">
					<img src="unit1_projects/images/index_wireframe.png" alt="wireframe">

				</a>
</div>

<p> A big part of the wireframe will be to have the links to the rest of DBC files at the top. THen a picture of myself to the left and then a summary directly to the right. Next I want two picture of rainforest animals right underneath. At the bottom I want to have more links to things associated with me.
