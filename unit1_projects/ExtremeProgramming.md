##Extreme Programming Explained

- problem is the cost of changing a piece of software necessarily rises dramatically over the course of time. How do you address that?

*Fundamentals*
  - *distinguish* between the decisions to be made by business interests and those to be made by project stakeholders.
  - *writing unit tests* before programming and keeping all of the tests running at all times.
  - *integrating* and testing the whole system - several times a day.
  - producing all software in *pairs*, two programmers at one screen.
  - starting projects with a simple design that constantly *evolves* to add needed flexibility adn remove unneeded complexity.
  - putting a minimal system into production *quickly* and growing it in whatever directions prove most valuable.

*Why is XP so controversial?*
  - don't force specializations among analysts, architects, programmers, testers, and integrators -- every XP programmers participates in all of these critical activities every day. 
  - don't conduct complete up-front analysis and design
    - an XP project starts with a quick analysis of make analysis and design decisions throughout development. 
  - develop infrastructure and frameworks as you develop your application, not up-front--delivering business value is *heartbeat* that drives XP projects.
  - don't write and maintain implementation documentation--communication in XP projects occurs face-to-face, or through efficient tests and carefully written code.
