<h3>Has technology created new problems for the world economy?
</h3>
<p>"It worries me, and I think that there are an awful lot of the problems that we have especially in this grotesque accumulation of wealth that have to do with the automation of the economy. As you eliminate friction, you have the opportunity for sudden, cyclonic buildups that respond to power laws that gather an awful lot energy into themselves, and there isn't an easy way to buffer against that, because the process has been so accelerated and made convenient."- John Perry Barlow
</p>
<p>As we become so civilized with all this technology it is making us much more materialistic and worldly. As one becomes wiser you realize that is "not enough",  we need more than just that. Besides that outward polish might hide a mans inner rotten self and allowing him to get ahead over someone who might be a little rough on the edges but whose heart is true. Materialism is sapping the spirit. Technology in some ways is making people weak and decadent lacking instinct, passion, and a fire that is capable of the understanding the truly beautiful things in life. 
</p>
<p>We have all this technology that is supposed to make the world smaller and more connected but the irony is that it isn't. People have all the semblance of being social and more connected with people that comes with social networks and the acummulation of friends. But too often those are used a facade to cover up a lack of real friends and connectivity that comes with face to face smiles, conversations, a loving punch on the shoulder, etc. It's hard to put that into text or even in pixalated moment in time.

<h3>Solution
</h3>
<p>I suppose technology can eventualy find a patch for even these problems with ever higher technology. One solution could be for people to put technology away every once in a while to enjoy the world that is right in front of them instead of something in a machine. The allure of technology, information, and constant stimulation from doing something is too alluring to break free from. Children are getting hooked younger and younger these days. Putting limits, regulations, recommendations on the use of tech seems like overkill. I guess we have to realise that we may have the mind for all this technology but not the body, and without the body the mind can not go as far as it should.
