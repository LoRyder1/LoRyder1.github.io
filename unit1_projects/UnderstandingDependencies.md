**Understanding Dependencies**

- it is difficult to talk about OOP without mentioning dependencies, loose coupling, and with good reason. 

**What is a Dependency?**

  - A dependant depends on its dependencies.
  - two classes that uses each other are called coupled. The coupling between classes can be "loose" or "tight", or somewhere in between. The tightness of a coupling is not binary. It is not eiher loose or tight. The degrees of tightness are continous, not discrete. 
  - It is also possible to describe or characterize dependencies as "strong" or "weak". A tight coupling leads to strong dependencies, and a loose coupling leads to weak dependencies, or even no dependencies in some situations. 
  - Dependencies or couplings, are directional. When A depends on B doesn't mean that B also depends on A.
