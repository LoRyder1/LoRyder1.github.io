<em>Week #1: </em>

<h3>Week 1 Cultural Blog
</h3>
<p>Based on the video my take on the DBC experience is that it is not designed as a restaurant where you pay your fees get some objectives done and learned and then get a job. The DBC experience is designed to give us an environment where we can grow and learn. DBC is about setting the right conditions and give us the opportunity for growth. The way Mr. Bishay described the program he wanted us not to ask what DBC can do for me but what can I do for DBC. 
</p>
<p>I think the program is designed so that yeah you can coast and do the bare minimum to survive and pass the challenges. But to really excel and get the most out of DBC it is necessary to be full throttle into the challenges and exercise "you get what you put in". This reminds me of a song from the Beatles with the lyrics: "In the end the love you make is equal to the love you get". 
</p>
<p>The culture at DBC is all about developing emotional intelligence. In the fireside talk it was mentioned that 50% of coding is about figuring out problem and describing problem. The other 50% is actually coding. A lot of learning is about working with your collegaues and learning from them as well as you teaching them. 
</p>
<p>I see myself really engaging in this type of culture because it is important. It is important to be a net positive in whatever environment you are in. The companies and groups that really thrive are the ones that work together the most and the best. 
</p>
<p>My expectations of DBC have not changed that much. It is the experiences that we remember the most and gain the most from. I am excited to participate in this kind of learning because there is sooo much to learn and I have never been in these kind of environments for a continuous 9 weeks. The environment makes me a little nervous; will i thrive in an environment like this? will i be the best that i can be? 

</p>
<p>Mr. Bishay mentioned that he was a natural introvert I am a natural intorvert as well so I find really social situations kind of draining. Although I work well with people and am quite social its just that it takes something out of me. I guess you have to not always play your strengths you also have to play your weaknesses and improve them.
