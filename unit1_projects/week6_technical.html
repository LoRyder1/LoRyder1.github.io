<h3> OO vs. Functional Programming
</h3>
<p> "I guess I can start with describing OO as making code understandable by encapsulating moving parts while FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts."
</p>
<p> A lot of people describe this as a tension between the two different styles in programming. While OO tries to control state behind object interfaces, FP tries to minimize state by using pure functions as much as possible. 
</p>
<p> Most people try to incorporate FP in their OO but this is next to impossible but in order to get the full benefit of either programming method you need an exclusive commitment. As an example you can look at functions where it is easier to debug when you have all your ducks in a row. Most people recognize that it is hard to 100% functional because doing that makes it impractical. <p>
</p>

<h3>Functional in the small, OO in the large
</h3>
<p> Ideally functional programming should be used in the small that is the individual methods but the whole picture code can be bundled into an object for other parts of an application to use. The grand structure would be object oriented, but the small structure would be functional.
