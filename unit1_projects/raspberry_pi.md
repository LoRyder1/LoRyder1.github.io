# Getting Started with Raspberry Pi 

What does it mean to say that Pi is a fully functional computer? The Pi runs at 1.2GHz. - 64-bit 1.2GHz quad-core CPU with 1GB of RAM, 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This allows it to run a myriad of different operating systems. 

#Energy consumption

Raspberry Piz cost almost nothing to run. This makes the Pi remarkably attractive as an always-on linux server or base for your connected hardware projects. Consumption depends on the model and there are ways to reduce consumption even further, but a Pi 3 Model B will draw around 1.4W at idle and upt to 3.7W at load. 

The diminuitive Pi power needs opens the door for interesting mobile and embedded uses as it can be powered by a normal USB battery pack for a good while. 

#Uses of a Raspberry Pi

Network-attached storage (NAS) is a file-level computer data storage server connected to a computer network providing data access to a heterogeneous group of clients. NAS is specialized for serving files either by its hardware, software, or configuration. It is often manufactured as a computer appliance - a purpose-built specialized computer. NAS systems are networked appliances which contain one or more storage drives, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID.
