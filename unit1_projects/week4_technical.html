<h3>Discussing the various ways to loop in Ruby
</h3>
<p>The ways to loop include: unconditional loop, the while loop, the until loop, using while and until and simulating do, for loop. 
</p>
<p>The unconditional loop is the simplest way to loop. This is actually not a loop but is really an iterator method. You can use this method when you want an infinite loop. To break the loop you can use break, next or redo keywords. 
</p>
<p>The while loop is very standard and does do anything too fancy it is comparative to other languages.
</p>
<p>The until loop is similar to the while loop but the logic is reversed. 
</p>

<p>While and until keywords can also be used as modifiers, which means you can put them at the end of an expression just like you can do with the if statement. 
</p>
<p>The for loop method acts a kind of bridge between looping constructs and iterators. The for loop almost acts as an iterator without actually taking a block. For example you can use the for loop to loop over values in a range.
