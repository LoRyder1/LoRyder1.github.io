<h3>France24.com
</h3>

<p>

The problem the web page is solving is that of displaying news most effectively. The website tries to add images and videos as well have an index on the sidebar. France24 tries to disseminate a lot of information into a small space (the computer screen). The fact that the computer screen is too small to fit everything one would want is one of the visual challenges. I think it would be beneficial to cut down on the extra stuff on the webpage and just focus on what is important. The website is too distracted.

<h4>Fitbit.com
</h4>

<p>The webpage's primary aim is to solicit customers for their products especially the newest ones. Fitbit is a wrist technology that functions like a pedometer and so keeps track of your daily activity so it can be later stored and analysed on the computer. The website tries also has the main navigation buttons on the top where you can sign in and join the social network the company has. The visual challenges the webpage has is to be simple, practical, and seductive. I believe the website accomplishes those goals.

<h5>Apple.com
</h5>

<p>The primary aim of the website is introducing apple products. The website has the typical navigation buttons on top so you can go where you want to go in a jiffy. The main portion of the website is dedicated to visually stimulating the customer on the website. The image markets the flagship product of the company and has a one line sentence and a link to a video. Individuals process the visual deeper than the written word and I believe that is what the website is attempting to do. Toward the bottom of the page there are more images trumpeting the environmental causes the company supports and more products represented visually.
